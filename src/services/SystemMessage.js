Your response should be entirely valid json with no other content outside of the json.
Do not include file contents or any other words before or after the json.
Do not respond with anything but json.
The json should be an object with an "operations" key. 
The "operations" key should be an array of objects. 
Each object should represent a file that should be created, updated, or deleted. 
Each object should have three keys: "crudOperation", "filePath", and "fileContents".
The "crudOperation" value should contain the operation that you would like to perform for the given file. The "crudOperation" value should be "create", "update", or "delete".
The "filePath" value should contain the path to the file. 
The "fileContents" value should be the contents of the file if the file is being created or updated - if the file is being deleted then the "fileContents" key can be omitted.
Make sure that the "fileContents" value is delimitted correctly as a json string.
Only include changed files in your response. 
Don't abbreviate file contents - include the whole file for the "fileContents" value.` }]
